#Limitations and Suggested Solutions

While the application offers a robust foundation for rental management, there are certain limitations that can be addressed to improve functionality, user experience, and scalability. The following section outlines these limitations along with recommended solutions.

1. Lack of User Panel for Renters
Limitation: The current system is designed exclusively for administrative use, with no interface or functionalities available for end-users (renters).

Solution: Implement a separate user panel that allows renters to browse listings, request rentals, and manage their bookings. Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between admin and renter privileges.

2. Absence of Persistent Data Storage
Limitation: All data manipulation (add, update, delete) is handled on the client-side, which means changes are lost upon page refresh or session end.

Solution: Integrate a backend database such as **Firebase**, **MongoDB**, or **MySQL** to store rental listings, user credentials, and system data. Utilize API calls to ensure synchronization between frontend and backend.

3. Basic Authentication Mechanism
Limitation: The login system relies on static credentials, offering minimal security and exposing the system to unauthorized access.

Solution: Incorporate a secure server-side authentication system using frameworks like **Node.js with JWT**, **PHP with session management**, or **Django Authentication**. Ensure passwords are stored in hashed form using encryption standards such as **bcrypt**.

4. No Payment Gateway Integration
Limitation: The platform currently does not support any method for processing payments related to rental transactions.

Solution: Integrate payment solutions such as **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Razorpay** to handle secure online payments. Include transaction history and verification steps for transparency and security.

5. Limited Error Handling and Validation
Limitation: The application uses basic client-side validation, lacking comprehensive error detection and feedback mechanisms.

Solution: Enhance validation by implementing detailed error handling both on the client and server side. Use try-catch blocks, proper status codes, and user-friendly error messages to improve reliability.

6. Missing Activity Logs and Reporting
Limitation: There is no mechanism to track administrative actions or generate usage reports for system monitoring and auditing.

Solution: Develop a logging system to record all critical actions and user interactions. Include a report generation feature for rental trends, inventory changes, and system analytics.

7. Legal and Ethical Considerations
Limitation: Renting out Netflix accounts may violate Netflix’s Terms of Service, potentially leading to account suspension or legal action.

Solution: Review and ensure compliance with Netflix’s policies. Consider modifying the platform’s business model to focus on legally shareable digital subscriptions or tools that help users manage shared access responsibly.
