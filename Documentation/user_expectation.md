# User Expectations**

For our project "Online Rental Services", it is important to understand what users expect from such a platform to ensure it meets their needs effectively. Based on the platform idea (renting OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime, etc., for a limited time), here are the key expectations:

1. **Quick and Hassle-Free Access**  
   Users want to access content platforms instantly after payment without long waits or manual steps.

2. **Flexible Rental Duration**  
   The ability to rent services for 1 hour, 3 hours, or longer, depending on their needs.

3. **Affordable Pricing**  
   Users expect the rental cost to be cheaper than buying full monthly subscriptions.

4. **Smooth and Secure Payment**  
   Easy payment options with trust that their transaction is secure and credentials are safe.

5. **Clear Information Display**  
   Platform should clearly show which OTT services are available, pricing per hour, and time left after renting.

6. **Good User Experience (UX)**  
   A clean, easy-to-use interface — inspired by Netflix/Spotify — so users can rent and watch/listen with minimal effort.

7. **Support for Issues**  
   If access fails or users have questions, they expect fast customer support or chat help.

8. **Privacy and Trust**  
   They want to know that temporary accounts or access links are handled securely and won’t be misused.

Meeting these expectations is key to building trust, increasing user satisfaction, and ensuring long-term success of the platform.
