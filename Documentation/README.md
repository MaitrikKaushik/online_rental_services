# Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced digital world, users often need temporary access to premium content platforms like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, etc., but may not want to purchase full subscriptions. This creates a demand for short-term, affordable access.
Our project, "Online Rental Services", aims to provide a platform where users can rent access to popular streaming and content services on an hourly basis. This will help people save money and use the platform only when needed.
We will build a secure, user-friendly system where users can choose a service, select the number of hours they want access, make the payment, and instantly receive login credentials or tokens.
This system will help bridge the gap between affordability and accessibility in the digital subscription space.
